## 1. Executive Summary

### The Opportunity

A retrenched individual seeks capital to start a Bak Chor Mee (BCM) hawker stall, leveraging his family's existing recipe. He is approaching reservist NSMen friends as "silent partners" for funding.

### Deal Terms

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Total Capital Required** | **SGD 100,000** |
| Per Partner | $25,000 × 4 partners |
| Breakdown | $36K CapEx + $64K Working Capital (14mo runway) |
| Partner Structure | 1 Operator + 1 Active + 2 Silent |
| Profit Share | **25/25/25/25 split** |
| Exit Mechanism | Undefined |

### Key Findings

| Dimension | Assessment | Rating |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| Macro Environment (PESTLE) | Hostile — GST↑, labor shortage, margin compression | 🔴 Unfavorable |
| Industry Structure (Five Forces) | Unattractive — high rivalry, high buyer power | 🔴 Unfavorable |
| Operator Readiness (SWOT) | Weak — no recent experience, no capital commitment | 🟡 Neutral |
| Funding Signal (Source Ladder) | Red flag — not pursuing banks/family first | 🔴 Unfavorable |
| Financial Projections (Realistic) | **Negative EV** per partner over 3 years | 🔴 Unfavorable |
| Regulatory Structure | **Unenforceable** revenue-share; Individual license only | 🔴 Deal-Breaker |
| Probability-Weighted EV | **–$18,181 per partner** | 🔴 Unfavorable |
| Probability of Loss | **70%** (Failure 40% + Worst 30%) | 🔴 Unfavorable |

### Recommendation

> **THE BOTTOM LINE (Read This First)**
>
> **You are paying $25,000 for an expected return of –$18,181 over 3 years.**
>
> Unlike a cafe or restaurant, there is **limited conventional Enterprise Value at exit**. You cannot sell the NEA tenancy (it reverts to NEA upon surrender). Any value is in **brand/recipe/process**, which is harder to monetise or secure for investors. You are buying a cash flow stream, not a sellable asset.
>
> That's it. That's the whole deal.

> **DO NOT INVEST FOR ROI. INVEST ONLY AS A GIFT.**
>
> The probability-weighted NPV is **–$18,181 per partner**.
>
> **Probability of Loss**: **70%** (40% failure + 30% worst case)
>
> **If you invest expecting returns**: You have a 70% chance of losing money.
>
> **If you invest as a gift**: You're backing a friend. Write off the $25k. If it works out, treat any return as a bonus.
>
> **This is not an investment. It's a donation with extra steps.**

## 2. Deal Overview

### 2.1 Background

The prospective operator:

- Recently retrenched from corporate employment
- Family previously operated a BCM stall (parents retired, no successor)
- Claims to possess the original recipe and access to parental guidance
- Unable or unwilling to seek employment; prefers entrepreneurship

### 2.2 Capital Request

The operator is seeking:

- 2 silent partners (capital providers)
- 1 active partner (operations support)
- Initial stall, with expansion once "stable and profitable"

### 2.3 Red Flags Identified

| Observation | Implication |
|-------------|-------------|
| Approaching reservist NSMen friends, not banks | Cannot obtain institutional financing |
| Approaching friends, not family | Family declined or was not consulted |
| No personal capital contribution | Zero skin in the game |
| Undefined exit mechanism | No liquidity for investors |
| "Stable and profitable before expansion" | Vague milestone; no KPIs defined |

### 2.4 Operator Experience Check (CRITICAL)

**The Question You Must Ask**:

> "Do you know what your COGS percentage should be? What's your target food cost per bowl? How many bowls do you need to sell per day to break even?"

If the operator **cannot answer these questions**, he is not ready.

| Signal | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| Doesn't know COGS % | Cannot manage margins |
| Doesn't know break-even volume | No financial planning |
| "I'll figure it out" | Expensive learning curve on YOUR money |
| Has worked in FnB before | Green flag — knows the rhythm |
| Has run numbers on paper | Green flag — has done basic planning |

> **Pro Tip**: If he doesn't know the numbers, show him this report. If he can't understand it, stay away.

---

## 3. Regulatory Feasibility (The "Kill Switch")

### 3.1 Step 0: Identify Stall Regime (Critical)

Before analyzing economics, confirm the regulatory environment:

**A. NEA-Managed Hawker Centre** (Most likely for BCM)

- **Rules**: Strict personal operation. No subletting. No assignment.
- **Investor Role**: Cannot legally own the stall license. Must be "silent".
- **Risk**: Unsecured creditor.

**B. Social Enterprise Hawker Centre (SEHC)** (e.g., Feiniong)

- **Rules**: Managed by private operator. Often similar restrictions to NEA, plus price caps.
- **Investor Role**: Contract with operator; still restrictive.

**C. Coffeeshop / Private Canteen**

- **Rules**: Commercial lease.
- **Investor Role**: Can own equity in lease-holding company.
- **Risk**: Higher rent, but legally cleaner.

> **Assumption**: This report assumes **Scenario A (NEA-Managed)** as it is the standard for heritage hawkers.

> **Can this be legally structured as a "silent partner" deal under NEA rules?**
>
> **Short Answer: Not for equity in the stall itself.**
>
> You *cannot* hold equity or ownership in an NEA hawker stall license — it's issued to individuals only. However, you *can* structure a **private contract** (loan, revenue share, equipment lien), but enforceability and practical control are weak.

### 3.2 NEA Ownership Constraints

| Rule | Implication | Source |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **Individual Only** | NEA generally does not allow corporates to bid for hawker stalls. Tenancy is in **one person's name**. | NEA FAQ |
| **SG Citizen/PR** | Only Singapore Citizens or PRs aged 21+ can apply. | NEA |
| **No Subletting** | The licensee must **personally conduct/superintend** the business. Subletting or proxy operation = **termination risk**. | NEA Terms |

### 3.2 What This Means for "Silent Partners"

| Your Role | Legal Reality |
|-----------|---------------|
| "Silent Partner" | You have **zero legal claim** on the stall. The license is in *his* name. |
| "Investor" | Your money is an **unsecured personal loan** to the operator. No collateral. |
| "Exit" | You cannot "sell your share." There is no share to sell. |

### 3.3 Compliant vs Non-Compliant Structures

| Structure | Compliant? | Risk |
|-----------|------------|------|
| **Gift with handshake profit-sharing** | 🟡 Technically legal, but unenforceable | High |
| **Personal loan with repayment schedule** | 🟢 Legal, enforceable | Medium (default risk) |
| **Revenue-based financing agreement** | 🟢 Legal, enforceable | Medium |
| **Equity partnership in stall license** | 🔴 **Not possible** — license is individual | N/A |
| **You hold license, he operates** | 🔴 **Subletting risk** — NEA termination | Critical |

### 3.4 Tender Mechanics (Adds Friction)

| Requirement | Impact |
|-------------|--------|
| $500 tender deposit per stall | CapEx +$500 |
| 2 months' security deposit | CapEx +$3,500 |
| WSQ Food Safety training | Time + $100 |
| Tender success rate | Unpredictable; prime locations = bidding war |

> **Verdict**: The "silent partner" framing is **an unenforceable fiction**. Subletting is illegal under NEA rules; revenue-sharing is technically legal but **practically unenforceable**. You are giving an unsecured personal loan to a friend with no recourse if he walks away.

## 4. Macro Analysis (PESTLE)

| Factor | Trend | Impact on Investment | Source |
|--------|-------|---------------------|--------|
| **Political** | Govt supports hawker culture via NEA subsidies | 🟢 Positive (rent subsidies) | NEA (2024) |
| **Political** | Subsidized stalls must offer "Value Meals" (various price points) | 🔴 Negative (margin pressure) | SetHui (2024) |
| **Economic** | GST increased to 9% (Jan 2024) | 🔴 Negative (cost increase) | IRAS |
| **Economic** | Ingredient costs up 20-30% | 🔴 Negative | CNA (2024) |
| **Economic** | Hawker profits down 40% vs 5 years ago | 🔴 Negative | CNA (2024) |
| **Economic** | **3,047 F&B closures in 2024** — highest in 20 years | 🔴 Negative | ST (2024) |
| **Social** | 87.3% of Singaporeans unwilling to become hawkers | 🔴 Negative (labor shortage) | NEA Perception Survey 2018 |
| **Social** | "Back-breaking work, long hours" perception | 🔴 Negative | CNA (2024) |
| **Technological** | Food delivery apps take 30% commission | 🔴 Negative (margin erosion) | Industry data |
| **Legal** | NEA tender system (median rent **$2,200-$2,500** in 2025) | 🔴 Negative | NEA Tenders |
| **Legal** | **Rent-Footfall Paradox**: Cheap bids ($1.5k) = zero footfall locations. High-footfall (Amoy, Maxwell) = $4k-$6k bids. Operator likely modeling revenue on *busy* center but rent on *quiet* center. | 🔴 Negative | Industry Data |
| **Legal** | **Personal Operation Required** (No subletting) | 🔴 Deal-Breaker | NEA |
| **Legal** | S&CC increased 2x in 2024 | 🔴 Negative | ST (2024) |
| **Environmental** | Approved supplier restrictions | 🔴 Negative (cost inflexibility) | SetHui (2024) |

### PESTLE Verdict

**The macro environment is HOSTILE.**

Key headwinds:

1. Cost inflation (GST, ingredients, S&CC)
2. Labor scarcity (87% unwillingness rate)
3. Margin compression (40% profit decline)
4. Regulatory friction (mandatory $3 meals, approved suppliers)

---

## 5. Industry Analysis (Porter's Five Forces)

| Force | Intensity | Analysis |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| **Rivalry** | 🔴 HIGH | Thousands of BCM stalls in Singapore; product is commoditized; price competition intense |
| **Buyer Power** | 🔴 HIGH | Customers are price-sensitive; low switching costs; no loyalty programs |
| **Supplier Power** | 🟡 MEDIUM | Ingredients are commoditized, but NEA-approved supplier rules add cost |
| **New Entrants** | 🟡 MEDIUM | Low CapEx ($20-30K), but NEA tender queue creates friction |
| **Substitutes** | 🔴 HIGH | Mala, chicken rice, prata, yong tau foo — all compete for $5-6 lunch budget |

### Five Forces Verdict

**Industry structure is UNATTRACTIVE.**

The combination of high rivalry, high buyer power, and high substitution threat creates persistent margin pressure. Only operators with exceptional efficiency or brand differentiation can sustain profitability.

---

## 6. Internal Analysis (SWOT)

### 6.1 Strengths

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Recipe exists (family heritage) | Moderate competitive advantage if recipe is genuinely superior |
| Potential for NEA subsidized rent | Cost advantage if tender is won |
| Familiar comfort food | Stable demand category |

### 6.2 Weaknesses

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Operator has no recent experience | Parents retired years ago; skills may be rusty |
| **"Hand" vs. "Recipe" Fallacy** | BCM is **technique-heavy**, not recipe-heavy. Unlike Chicken Rice (process-heavy) or Western Food (assembly-heavy), BCM relies on the *consistency* of the vinegar/chili toss and noodle texture. A recipe on paper means nothing if the operator hasn't cooked 1,000 bowls recently. The "Family Recipe" is a liability, not an asset. |
| No proven track record | New business, no existing customer base |
| Labor-intensive operations | Operator must work long hours consistently |
| No personal capital at risk | Operator has zero skin in the game |

> **⚠️ DD Action**: Add a **"Taste Test" milestone** before committing capital. Have the operator cook 50 bowls for blind taste testing. If the product isn't objectively good, the recipe is worthless.

### 6.3 Opportunities

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| NEA Hawker Incubator Scheme | Subsidized rent and training available |
| LTVP hiring (Jan 2025) | Eased foreign labor restrictions |
| Foodie culture revival | Social media potential for viral marketing |

### 6.4 Threats

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| GST 9% + ingredient inflation | Margin compression |
| 87% labor pool unwillingness | Hiring difficulty |
| Food delivery 30% commission | Digital channel margin erosion |
| High stall rental bids (CBD) | Location competition |

---

## 7. Strategic Options (TOWS Matrix)

|  | **Opportunities** | **Threats** |
|--|------------------|-------------|
| **Strengths** | **SO Strategy**: Leverage family recipe + NEA incubator for low rent entry | **ST Strategy**: Recipe differentiation to withstand margin pressure |
| **Weaknesses** | **WO Strategy**: Use govt schemes (incubator, LTVP) to de-risk learning curve | **WT Strategy**: Exit or pivot if labor/cost squeeze intensifies |

### TOWS Verdict

**Optimal strategy is WO** — use government support schemes to mitigate operator weaknesses.

**However**: This is the *operator's* strategy, not the *investor's* strategy. The investor's optimal strategy is **avoidance** unless terms significantly favor capital protection.

---

## 8. Capital Structure Analysis

### 8.1 The Funding Source Ladder

Capital sources reveal risk appetite and credibility. The hierarchy:

| Level | Source | Signal |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 1 | **Personal Savings** | "I believe in this enough to risk my own money" |
| 2 | **Family** | "My closest relationships trust me and will be patient" |
| 3 | **Bank (EFS-WCL)** | "I have financials and a plan that passed institutional scrutiny" |
| 4 | **Friends** | "I cannot obtain Level 1-3 funding" |
| 5 | **Angels/VCs** | "I have a scalable pitch worth professional diligence" |

### 8.2 Operator's Position

The operator is approaching **Level 4 (Friends)** — specifically, reservist **NSMen** acquaintances.

**Critical Questions**:

| Question | Red Flag If... |
|----------|----------------|
| Why not personal savings? | Operator has no capital = no skin in game |
| Why not family? | Family declined or wasn't asked = they know something |
| Why not bank (EFS-WCL)? | Banks offer up to $500K with 50% govt risk-share; rejection implies weak application |

### 8.3 Bank Financing Requirements (EFS-WCL)

| Requirement | Operator's Likely Status |
|-------------|-------------------------|
| 6 months operating history | ❌ None (new business) |
| Financial statements | ❌ None |
| Business plan | ❓ Unknown |
| Personal credit score | ❓ Unknown (recently retrenched) |
| 30% local shareholding | ✅ Likely met |

**Verdict**: If the operator had a credible business plan and financials, enterprise loans are readily available. The fact that he is approaching **reservist friends instead of institutions** suggests either:

1. Banks declined the application, OR
2. He knows the plan won't pass institutional scrutiny

Both are **significant red flags**.

## 9. Financial Projections

### 9.1 Assumptions

| Assumption | Value | Rationale |
|------------|-------|-----------|
| **Operating Model** | One-man show | Operator runs stall solo; no hired labor |
| **Operating Days** | **26 days/month** | 6 days/week + ~5% downtime (illness, rest) |
| **Revenue** | $10,400 - $15,600/month | 80-120 bowls/day @ $5/bowl, **26 days** |
| **Total Capital** | **$100,000** | 4 partners × $25,000 each |
| **CapEx (Gross)** | $36,000 | $30k Equipment + $5k Deposits + $1k Training |
| **Working Capital** | $64,000 | ~14 months OpEx runway |
| **Salvage Value (Gross)** | **$2,000** | ⚠️ Forced exits = scrap metal prices |
| **Liquidation Costs** | $1,500 | Transport + broker fees |
| **Salvage Value (Net)** | **$500** | Gross – Liquidation Costs (near-zero recovery) |
| **Discount Rate** | 8% | Opportunity cost of capital |

---

### 9.2 Capital Structure (Revised: $100K Model)

> **Total Raise**: $100,000 (4 partners × $25,000 each)

| Partner | Role | Contribution | Share |
|---------|------|--------------|-------|
| **Operator** | Runs the stall daily | $25,000 + Sweat Equity | 25% |
| **Active Partner** | Oversight, admin, DD | $25,000 | 25% |
| **Silent Partner A** | Capital only | $25,000 | 25% |
| **Silent Partner B** | Capital only | $25,000 | 25% |

#### Use of Funds

| Category | Amount | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **CapEx** | $36,000 | Equipment, deposits, training |
| **Working Capital** | $64,000 | ~14 months OpEx runway |
| **Total** | $100,000 | |

> **Runway Math**: $64,000 ÷ $4,550/mo OpEx = **~14 months** before profitability required.

---

### 9.3 Profit Split: 25/25/25/25 Pure Model

> **No salary deduction first.** All profit split equally among 4 partners.

| Scenario | Monthly Pot | Per Partner (25%) | Annual | ROI on $25K |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|--------|-------------|
| **Worst** | $650 | $162.50 | $1,950 | **7.8%** |
| **Realistic** | $1,950 | $487.50 | $5,850 | **23.4%** |
| **Best** | $3,250 | $812.50 | $9,750 | **39.0%** |

#### Payback Period (Simple, No Discounting)

| Scenario | Annual Return | Payback = $25K ÷ Annual |
|----------|---------------|-------------------------|
| **Worst** | $1,950 | **12.8 years** |
| **Realistic** | $5,850 | **4.3 years** |
| **Best** | $9,750 | **2.6 years** |

> **Reality Check**: Even in the *realistic* case, you're waiting **4+ years** to get your money back — and that's assuming:
>
> 1. The stall survives (40% fail in Year 1)
> 2. The operator reports honestly (no enforcement)
> 3. No rent increases or margin compression
>
> **Compare**: A fixed deposit returns your principal on Day 1 with 3% interest.

### 9.3 Pro Forma Monthly P&L (2025 Benchmarks)

| Line Item | Worst | Realistic | Best | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-----------|------|-------|
| **Revenue** | $10,400 | $13,000 | $15,600 | 80-120 bowls/day × 26 days |
| COGS (50%) | $5,200 | $6,500 | $7,800 | Includes **9% GST absorption** (suppliers charge, stall cannot claim) |
| **Gross Profit** | $5,200 | $6,500 | $7,800 | |
| **Rent (2025)** | $2,500 | $2,500 | $2,500 | NEA Tender Median |
| Utilities/Fees | $800 | $1,000 | $1,200 | Heavy equipment (freezers/warmers) |
| Misc/Cleaning | $500 | $700 | $900 | Table cleaning (2025 rates) |
| Repairs/Maintenance | $150 | $150 | $150 | Equipment wear |
| POS/Transaction Fees | $100 | $100 | $100 | Cloud POS subscription |
| Spoilage/Voids | $100 | $100 | $100 | ~1% of revenue |
| **Relief Cook (4 days/mo)** | $500 | $500 | $500 | $125/day × 4 days (illness, rest) |
| **Total OpEx** | $4,550 | $4,550 | $4,550 | |
| **Operating Profit (before payouts)** | **$650** | **$1,950** | **$3,250** | **This is the "pot" to split** |

> **⚠️ INDUSTRY BENCHMARK (King of Fried Rice Model)**
>
> Even **top-performing** hawker chains like King of Fried Rice (35 outlets, ex-Jumbo chef) operate on **~10% net margins BEFORE operator salary**. This deal assumes the operator takes 50% of gross profit as compensation — meaning your share is split from an already-thin margin.
>
> **Reality Check**: Best-case margin of ~24% ($3.75K on $15.6K revenue) leaves ~12% after operator's 50% share. Industry data: net margins 10-15% after overheads (Kitchen Union SG, 2024).

### 9.5 NPV Analysis (Per Partner: $25K at Risk)

> **Why NPV?** For multi-year investments, NPV captures the **time value of money**.

**Formula**: NPV = –Investment + Σ (Annual Cash Flow / (1 + r)^t)

**Discount Rate**: 8% | **Investment per Partner**: $25,000

| Scenario | Annual Return | Y1 PV | Y2 PV | Y3 PV | Total PV | **NPV** |

### 9.7 The Verdict: 4-Way Split Model

| Metric | Value | Verdict |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **Expected NPV (per partner)** | **–$18,181** | ❌ DO NOT INVEST |
| **Best-Case ROI** | 39%/yr | Attractive IF it happens |
| **Probability of Loss** | **70%** (Failure 40% + Worst 30%) | ❌ Too risky |
| **Breakeven Probability** | <5% | ❌ Unrealistic |

> **Bottom Line**: Even with $100K total capital and 4-way split, the probability-weighted outcome is **negative $18K per partner** over 3 years.
>
> - 70% chance you lose money
> - 25% chance you earn ~$5,850/year (23% ROI — attractive but only 1-in-4 odds)
> - 5% chance you hit the best case
>
> **The math doesn't work. The structure doesn't work. Don't invest.**

---

### 9.8 Comparison: BCM vs Alternatives (Per $25K)

| Option | 3-Year Return | Risk | Effort |
|--------|---------------|------|--------|
| **Fixed Deposit @ 3%** | +$2,300 | Zero | Zero |
| **REITs @ 5%** | +$4,000 | Low | Low |
| **BCM (Best Case)** | +$127 | High | High (Worry) |
| **BCM (Expected/Weighted)** | **–$18,181** | High | High |

> **The Premium Question**: The probability-weighted NPV is **–$18,181 per partner**. You're better off with a savings account.

---

### 9.9 Key Insight

> **Even if individual scenarios can work, the probability-weighted expectation does not.**
>
> - Best case NPV is barely positive (+$127 per partner)
> - BUT: 40% failure + 30% worst-case = **70% chance of loss**
> - **Expected NPV is –$18,181 per partner**
> - Plus: You're betting on operator honesty with zero enforcement
>
> **Bottom Line**: The math doesn't work. The structure doesn't work. Don't invest.

```

#### Key Takeaways

1. **Daily Volume and Average Ticket = Most Sensitive** — A 20% drop in either destroys the already-negative NPV. Achieving upside requires *sustained* above-average performance.
2. **Rent = Third Largest Driver** — 2025 NEA rent increases have already locked in $2,500 floor. Upside limited; downside protected.
3. **COGS = Moderate Sensitivity** — Ingredient inflation is the operator's primary concern; investor has no control.
4. **Discount Rate & Salvage = Noise** — These are second-order effects. Don't over-model them.

> **Insight**: The variables you *cannot* control (rent, volume, ticket price) are the ones that matter most. This confirms the **Structural Disadvantage Ratio** assessment.

## 10. Risk Assessment

### 10.1 Risk Matrix

| Risk Category | Probability | Impact | Mitigation | Residual Risk |
|---------------|-------------|--------|------------|---------------|
| Operator abandonment | Medium | Critical | None (no lock-in) | 🔴 High |
| Cash flow manipulation | High | High | Auditing (but impractical) | 🔴 High |
| Friendship damage | High | Medium | Clear documentation | 🟡 Medium |
| Market failure (Y1) | **40%** | Critical | None | 🔴 High |
| Margin compression | High | Medium | Operator efficiency | 🔴 High |

### 10.2 Principal-Agent Risk (Legal Reality)

| Agent | Incentive | Risk to Principal | Mitigation |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|------------|
| Operator | **Legal Owner** | The license is in **his name only**. You have **zero legal claim**. | **None (Regulatory constraint)** |
| Operator | Salary vs Profit | Incentive to "load" costs to reduce profit share. | **Revenue Share** |
| Operator | Cash Flow | Controls daily cash. | **Cloud POS** |

---

### 10.3 Relationship Risk

| Scenario | Consequence |
|----------|-------------|
| Business succeeds | Operator may resent sharing 50% with "passive" investor |
| Business fails | Investor blames operator; friendship destroyed |
| Disputes arise | No formal governance; resolution unclear |

---

## 11. Recommendation

### 11.1 Investment Decision

> **DO NOT INVEST FOR ROI.**
>
> **INVEST ONLY IF THIS IS A GIFT.**

### 11.2 Rationale

1. **Negative Expected NPV**: The probability-weighted NPV is **–$18,181 per partner** over 3 years. Best case barely breaks even.
2. **Regulatory Deal-Breaker**: The "silent partner" structure is legally unenforceable for *equity in the stall license* under NEA rules. You have no security, no equity, and no control.
3. **Adverse Selection**: The operator is seeking "friendly" capital because institutional capital (Bank/Family) has likely rejected the business plan.

### 11.3 The "Friendship Grant" Alternative

If you want to support your friend, do not pretend it is an investment.

| Option | Amount | Structure | Expectation |
|--------|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **Gift** | $5,000 - $10,000 | Ang Bao / Gift | Write it off immediately. If he pays you back, great. |
| **Loan** | $10,000 - $15,000 | Personal Loan Agreement | Standard interest (0-2%). Enforceable in Small Claims Tribunal. |
| **Investment** | $25,000 | **Unenforceable** | Expected loss: –$18,181. **Not recommended.** |

### 11.4 Asset Allocation Reality Check

| Asset | Risk | Return | Effort |
|-------|------|--------|--------|
| **Fixed Deposit** | Zero | +2-3% | Zero |
| **Stall "Partner"** | Critical | **-100% to -67%** | High (Worrying about money) |

---

## 12. Term Sheet: If You Must Invest

> **"If you're going to be stupid, at least be structured about it."**

If you proceed despite the negative EV, here's how to structure the deal to minimize your loss.

### Instrument: Revenue-Based Financing (Not Equity)

| Term | Value | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| **Instrument** | Secured Loan with Revenue Kicker | You can't own equity in an NEA license anyway |
| **Principal** | $25,000 | Per-partner contribution |
| **Repayment** | 10% of Monthly Gross Revenue | Top-line skim; cannot be manipulated like profit |
| **Revenue Definition** | Gross sales (cash + QR + delivery) before GST, net of refunds/voids | Prevents under-reporting |
| **Repayment Cap** | 1.5x Principal ($37,500) | You get 50% return if it works |
| **Repayment Floor** | 3 years or Cap, whichever first | Time-boxed exit |
| Security | Equipment Lien + Assignment of Insurance | Some collateral |

> **⚠️ Regulatory Note**: Structuring this as a "revenue share" loan can risk violating the **Moneylenders Act** if done repeatedly. A cleaner approach is a "Friendly Loan" with a **fixed repayment sum** (e.g., "Lend $25k, repay $30k total") rather than a variable revenue kicker.

### Payment Waterfall

```
Monthly Gross Revenue
   └─→ 10% to Investor (Revenue Kicker)
   └─→ Remaining 90%
       └─→ Rent, COGS, Utilities
       └─→ Operator Living Wage ($3k)
       └─→ Retained Earnings / Buffer
```

### Default Triggers

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Missed remittance for 2 consecutive months | Default declared; equipment lien enforced |
| POS system access revoked | Default declared |
| Stall closed >14 days without notice | Default declared |
| Operator abandons stall | Equipment sold; proceeds to Investor first |

### Information Rights (Mandatory)

1. **Cloud POS Access**: Real-time view of all transactions.
2. **Bank Statement Read-Only**: Monthly statement shared.
3. **Quarterly P&L**: Operator provides simplified P&L.

### Dispute Resolution

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Governing Law | Singapore |
| Venue | Singapore Mediation Centre (SMC) |
| Escalation | SIAC Arbitration if mediation fails |

## 13. DD Checklist: What to Verify Before You Discuss Terms

> **Don't even negotiate until you've checked these.**

### A. Regulatory Feasibility

- [ ] Confirm stall type: **NEA-managed** vs **Coffee Shop** vs **SEHC**
- [ ] SEHC stalls have additional "value meal" and fee obligations
- [ ] Confirm the operator has **SC/PR status** and is 21+
- [ ] Confirm tender deposit ($500) and security deposit (~$3,500) are budgeted
- [ ] **Ask: "Have you applied for the NEA Incubation Stall Programme (ISP)?"**
  - ISP offers 15 months subsidized rent for first-time hawkers
  - If no, he should apply BEFORE seeking friends' money

### B. Operator Readiness

- [ ] Ask: "What is your target COGS percentage?"
  - If he doesn't know, he's not ready.
- [ ] Ask: "How many bowls per day to break even?"
  - If he can't answer, he hasn't done the math.
- [ ] Ask: "Have you worked in F&B before?"
  - If no, he will learn on your money.
- [ ] Ask: "Who is your relief cook if you're sick?"
  - If no plan, **Key-Man Risk** is unmitigated.

### C. Unit Economics Validation

- [ ] Spend 2 days observing a similar BCM stall at the target location
- [ ] Count bowls served per hour during lunch peak
- [ ] Estimate daily revenue and compare to his projections
- [ ] If his projections are >30% higher than observation, he's delusional

### D. Cash Discipline Plan

- [ ] **Cloud POS**: Will he use one? (If no, you're blind.)
- [ ] **Separate Bank Account**: Business-only, no personal mixing.
- [ ] **Daily Deposit**: Cash deposited daily, not kept at home.

### E. Governance & Exit

- [ ] Is there a written agreement? (Handshake = worthless.)
- [ ] Is there a repayment schedule / revenue share defined?
- [ ] Is there a default clause?
- [ ] Is there a dispute resolution mechanism?

## 14. Pre-Mortem (The "I Told You So" Log)

> **Scenario Date**: December 2026 (1 Year Later)
> **Outcome**: The stall has closed. You lost $25,000.
> **Exercise**: We write the autopsy *now* to see if we can prevent the death.

### Why Did We Fail?

| Cause | Probability | The Story |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **The "26-Day Grind" Broke Him** | **60%** | "He started strong, but working 6 days a week, 12 hours a day, alone, broke him by Month 4. He got sick in May, closed for a week, lost momentum, and never recovered. He quit to drive Grab." |
| **Margin Compression** | **40%** | "We modeled $5.00 bowls. But ingredients went up 15%. Customers rebelled at $5.50. Margins dropped to 40%. There was no profit left to split." |
| **The "Friendly" Drift** | **90%** | "He stopped sending P&L updates in Week 6. You didn't want to nag him because he was 'stressed'. By the time you realized he was underwater, he had burned the cash float. You couldn't seize the equipment because it felt cruel." |
| **Regulatory Kill** | **10%** | "NEA did a spot check. Found he was paying you a 'revenue share' that looked like subletting. They revoked the license. You lost everything instantly." |

> **Preventative Action**: If you cannot solve for the **"26-Day Grind"** (e.g., funding a relief cook), **DO NOT INVEST**. This is the highest biological risk.

### Why This Works

| Traditional DD | Athena DD |
|----------------|-----------|
| Analyst writes draft, manager reviews | AI writes draft, **multiple SOTA models** review |
| Review takes days (calendar friction) | Review takes **minutes** (API calls) |
| One perspective (analyst bias) | **4+ model perspectives** (Gemini, Claude, GPT, Perplexity) |
| Errors caught late | Errors caught **in same session** |
| Cost: $5k+ | Cost: **~$5 API credits** |

### Peer Models Used in This Report

| Model | Role | Key Contribution |
|-------|------|------------------|
| **Gemini 3 Pro** | Challenger | Flagged EV inconsistency, SEHC rules |
| **Opus 4.6** | Structurer | Suggested Term Sheet, DD Checklist format |
| **GPT 5.2** | Devil's Advocate | Challenged "analyst cost savings" framing |
| **Grok 4.1** | Risk Assessor | Flagged Pre-Mortem as missing |

### Frameworks Applied

| Framework | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| PESTLE | Macro-environmental scanning |
| Porter's Five Forces | Industry attractiveness assessment |
| SWOT | Internal capability/external environment matrix |
| TOWS | Strategic option generation |
| Principal-Agent Theory | Incentive alignment analysis |
| NPV / DCF | Financial valuation |
| Expected Value | Probability-weighted outcome analysis |

### Analysis Timeline

| Legal/governance review | 1-2 weeks |
| Report compilation | 1 week |
| **Total** | **4-6 weeks** |

### The Value Proposition

> **"Bringing institutional-grade rigor to retail-level decisions where none usually exists."**

This report didn't save "$5,000 in analyst fees"—no firm would DD a $25k hawker deal.

What it *did* do:

1. **Created analysis that wouldn't exist otherwise** — Amateur investors usually rely on gut feel.
2. **Applied frameworks correctly** — PESTLE, Five Forces, EV calculation.
3. **Caught regulatory kill-switch** — NEA subletting rules = deal-breaker.
4. **Converted an emotional decision into a mathematical one** — "Help my friend?" → "EV is negative."
